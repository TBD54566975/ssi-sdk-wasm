# Versioning

The SSI SDK follows [Semantic Versioning rules](https://semver.org/) *as much as possible.*

> Given a version number MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH, increment the:
>
> 1. MAJOR version when you make incompatible API changes
> 2. MINOR version when you add functionality in a backwards compatible manner
> 3. PATCH version when you make backwards compatible bug fixes
>
> Additional labels for pre-release and build metadata are available as extensions to the MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH format.


Changes to APIs — public methods and interfaces — must be backwards compatible. Backwards compatible changes are
represented by **minor** and **patch** version updates. Breaking changes: removing or modifying existing public methods
or interfaces should be avoided in a non-backwards compatible manner, but when necessary, result in a **major** version
change.

# Releases

A release is a version-identified distribution of the SSI SDK. Releases can be found
on [GitHub’s release page](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/releases). Releases are always published via GitHub,
and reference a specific commit hash.

## Release Stability

Releases are classified into three main buckets: alpha, beta, and stable.

### Alpha

Alpha releases may include experimental or incomplete changes. They are not considered stable and are mostly useful for
developers. Alpha releases may be suffixed with *-alpha*, for example `v0.1.1-alpha`.

### Beta

Beta releases include feature complete changes that need to gain more confidence. Confidence is gained through developer
and user testing. Beta releases may contain potential bug fixes and patches that need quick adoption. Beta releases may
be suffixed with *-beta*, for example, `v0.2.3-beta`.

### Stable

Stable releases have been well tested and carry the highest level of confidence. They are suited for production-level
usage. They are not suffixed (e.g. `v0.5.2`).

## Release Information

1. **Who creates releases?**

The project maintainers are responsible for creates and managing releases. If you are interested in a release but there
isn’t one, consider referencing a specific commit hash (
e.g. `go get github.com/[TBD54566975/ssi-sdk](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk)@<commit-hash>`) or reaching out to
the team via Discord, the forums, or an issue.

2. **When do we cut a new release?**

Primarily when there are substantive feature changes or when having adoption of a release has some sort of utility —
whether to promote additional testing or to advocate for stability such as in the case of a bug fix.

3. **How are releases represented?**

Releases can be found on [GitHub’s release page](https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk/releases). Release notes
highlighting key changes accompany each release.

4. **Which release should I use?**

It depends on your intended usage. As a general rule you should use the highest numbered version release.

5. **I found a bug for a release, what should I do?**

Open a bug issue, please.
