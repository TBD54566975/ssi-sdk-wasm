# WASM bindings of ssi-sdk into javascript

https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk is the home of self soverign stuff at TBD, implented in golang. 
We want to use this from the web as well, this minimal demo shows how.

This is a sample webserver which serves up a sample js app from `static` which also contains the wasm bindings and wasm "binary".

# status
This just has some example usage of apis to start with.

# running web server to test out

`cd html && go run main.go` - then go to localhost:3000 to try it out!
