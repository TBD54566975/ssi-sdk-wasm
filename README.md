# ssi-sdk-wasm

# WASM bindings of ssi-sdk into javascript

The home of self soverign stuff at TBD, implented in golang. 
We want to use this from the web as well, this minimal demo shows how. WASM code generated from here: https://github.com/TBD54566975/ssi-sdk

`webserver` is a sample webserver which serves up a sample js app from `static` which also contains the wasm bindings and wasm "binary".

# Introduction
Named `ssi-sdk`, this SDK encapsulates a set of standards related
to [Self Sovereign Identity](http://www.lifewithalacrity.com/2016/04/the-path-to-self-soverereign-identity.html).
The `ssi-sdk` intends to provide flexible functionality based on a set of standards-based primitives for building
decentralized identity applications in a modular manner: with limited dependencies between components.

![ssi-sdk](doc/ssi-sdk.png)

The image above outlines the SDK's vision. Standards may be added and/or removed. The standards themselves are under
active development, and as such, are subject to change. When possible we aim to call out which versions or revisions of
standards we are building implementations against.

The SDK has not undergone any formal security review or audit, so please use with caution.

For more information, see the [vision document](doc/VISION.md).
